# Intro to Hockey Player Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a data analysis project involving hockey player data from pick224.com. The dataset contains information for multiple years and will be analyzed using multiple python libraries.  The objective of this portfolio project is to demonstrate data analysis skills using these libraries.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:
- **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides essential data structures like DataFrame and Series, making it easy to work with structured data efficiently.
- **Scipy**: Scipy is an ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It includes functions for various statistical tests, optimization, integration, interpolation, and more.
- **Statsmodels**: Statsmodels is a Python library that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a widely-used plotting library in Python that provides various tools for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Seaborn is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating visually appealing plots and supports various statistical plots like heatmaps, distribution plots, regression plots, and more.
- **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library in Python. It provides efficient implementations of various machine learning algorithms, tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and more.
